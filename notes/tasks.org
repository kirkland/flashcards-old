** DONE switch card and card_sound foreign keys			       :comp:
You have a foreign key in the wrong place.  Whichever class has the belongs_to gets the foreign key.  So, you should have a card_id in your card_sounds table, not a card_sounds_id in your cards table.  For reference, you did this correctly with the association between Decks and Users.

You can see a symptom of this brokenness by starting script/console and doing something like Card.last.card_sound

That should work, showing you the last Card's CardSound.  Instead, you get this:
ActiveRecord::StatementInvalid: SQLite3::SQLException: no such column: card_sounds.card_id: SELECT * FROM "card_sounds" WHERE ("card_sounds".card_id = 1)  LIMIT 1

See?  It's expecting a card_id in card_sounds, not a card_sound_id in cards.

I imagine you had to do some other workarounds to actually get this to work, so make sure to do some thorough testing after changing this; it's likely that other stuff is broken.
