Goal: Make a Rails app for creating and reviewing flashcards.

Basic Deck and Card models are set up. Now, I'd like to have a very simple way
of 'quizzing' the user on a deck.

I guess the best way would be to have one static page, and then use JavaScript
to update it as we go. Let's walk through the user experience:

-- Display front of first card. 
-- Click the 'Reveal' button.
-- Display back of first card.
-- Ask if correct? Clicking Yes or No will reveal next card, or summary if at
the end.
