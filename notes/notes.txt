Goal: Make a Rails app for creating and reviewing flashcards.

==========

Basic Deck and Card models are set up. Now, I'd like to have a very simple way
of 'quizzing' the user on a deck.

I guess the best way would be to have one static page, and then use JavaScript
to update it as we go. Let's walk through the user experience:

-- Display front of first card. 
-- Click the 'Reveal' button.
-- Display back of first card.
-- Ask if correct? Clicking Yes or No will reveal next card, or summary if at
the end.

Quiz should have a way to exit. Also doesn't need Register / Login buttons.
After quiz, should be redirected back to home, or somewhere else.

If not logged in, should have access only to quiz, not scaffolding for 
decks/cards, etc. 

Front page should have list of users, to see their decks.

...

After consideration, I decided that the quiz should have register/login
links, but they should be at the bottom. In fact, these links should always
be at the bottom.

Part 2
======

Need to clean up access for logged-in versus anonymous users.

If logged in, should have a navigation bar (at top?), with links to:
   - Home
   - My Decks
   - Edit Profile
   - Logout

If not logged in, should have navigation area with:
   - Home
   - Register
   - Login
